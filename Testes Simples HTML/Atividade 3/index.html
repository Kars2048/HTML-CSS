    I wish I found some better sounds<br>
    No one's ever heard<br>
    I wish I had a better voice<br>
    That sang some better words<br>
    I wish I found some chords<br>
    In an order that is new<br>
    I wish I didn't have to rhyme<br>
    Every time I sang<br>
    I was told when I get older<br>
    All my fears would shrink<br>
    But now I'm insecure<br>
    And I care what people think<br>
    My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
    My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    We're stressed out<br>
    Sometimes a certain smell will<br>
    Take me back to when I was young<br>
    How come I'm never able to identify<br>
    Where it's coming from?<br>
    I'd make a candle out of it<br>
    If I ever found it<br>
    Try to sell it, never sell out of it<br>
    I'd probably only sell one<br>
    It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose<br>
    Same clothes, home grown<br>
    The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam<br>
    But it would remind us of when<br>
    Nothing really mattered<br>
    Out of student loans and tree house homes<br>
    We all would take the latter<br>
    My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
    My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    Used to play pretend<br>
    Give each other different names
    We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away<br>
    Used to dream of outer space<br>
    But now they're laughing at our face singing<br>
    "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
    Used to play pretend<br>
    Give each other different names<br>
    We would build a rocket ship<br>
    And then we'd fly it far away<br>
    Used to dream of outer space<br>
    But now they're laughing at our face singing<br>
    "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    Wish we could turn back time<br>
    To the good old days<br>
    When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
    But now we're stressed out<br>
    We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
    We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money<br>
    Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
    We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money<br>
    Used to play pretend<br>
    Give each other different names<br>
    We would build a rocket ship<br>
    And then we'd fly it far away<br>
    Used to dream of outer space<br>
    But now they're laughing at our face saying<br>
    "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
